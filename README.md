This project covers three parts:

* **SQL Queries:** Practice with the *Great British Bakeoff* database to retrieve info about bakers, ingredients, and eliminations.
* **Database Design:** Normalized two sample datasets (sports cards and plants) into relational schemas with justifications.
* **Python Program:** Built a small app to simulate coin flips, dice rolls (6, 8, 10, 12 sides), and card draws (with or without Jokers).
